For this project I created a simple static landing page using Sass.

The 5 different aspects/tools I used to style the website were the following
    * Variables
    * Sass map
    * Nesting
    * Functions
    * Mixins


VARIABLES
Variables were used for the color scheme and for the mixin.


SASS MAP
Because I had different variables for the color schemes, I created a sass map to hold all the different colors.


NESTING
Nesting was used throughout the whole Sass document the create a clear structure.


FUNCTIONS
I creaed a function to simplify the process of specifying color


MIXINS
A mixin was created to simplify the process of making the website responsive by using media query
